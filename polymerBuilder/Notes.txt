Matrix of bond lengths calculated for [Si, C, N]

Bond length matrix:
[[2.2  1.8  1.75]
 [1.8  1.54 1.47]
 [1.75 1.47 1.45]]

Problems to solve : 
(1) algorithm tends to complete the shell of 'easy' sites: this leaves too many sites with incomplete shells.

(2) Clustering will favor carbon domains, but these will be interconnected as opposed to graphite-like. Not clear how one can induce the formation of such domains.

(3) seed 873: 3rd neighbor to site 5 not added whereas space seems to be available. find out why.



TODO list:
(i) add 'target_coord_nb' and 'connected_neighbors' to site properties. Update connected_neighbors (via get_connected_neighbors())
